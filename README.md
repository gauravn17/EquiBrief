AI Summarizer of Stocks

An AI-powered tool that extracts and summarizes key financial information from Indian companies‚Äô annual reports, earnings call transcripts, and investor presentations.

‚úÖ Designed to make important financial insights affordable and accessible for small finance firms, NBFCs, and individual analysts ‚Äî without the high costs of platforms like Bloomberg or FactSet.

üí° Why This Matters

Financial data should be accessible, not a luxury.

This tool democratizes access to structured insights for emerging finance professionals, startups, and smaller funds who need reliable data ‚Äî without paying $25,000 a year.
‚∏ª

üöÄ Project Goals
	‚Ä¢	Parse public documents (PDFs/text) from company websites, NSE/BSE, etc.
	‚Ä¢	Extract critical financial data:
	‚Ä¢	Revenue, Net Profit, Growth Rates
	‚Ä¢	Loan Book Size (for banks/NBFCs)
	‚Ä¢	Gross and Net NPA figures
	‚Ä¢	Management commentary and outlook
	‚Ä¢	Expansion plans and key risks
	‚Ä¢	Deliver clean, structured summaries ready for quick analysis.
	‚Ä¢	Build a low-cost, scalable alternative to expensive data platforms.

üß© Implementation Details

The AI Stock Summarizer works in a modular pipeline, broken down into three major stages:

1. Data Ingestion
	‚Ä¢	Source: Publicly available documents such as annual reports, earnings call transcripts, and investor presentations from Indian company websites, NSE/BSE filings.
	‚Ä¢	Files are manually downloaded (initial MVP) into the /data/ folder.

2. Document Parsing
	‚Ä¢	Text Extraction: Use pdfplumber to extract text cleanly from structured PDFs.
	‚Ä¢	OCR (optional): For scanned or image-based PDFs, fallback to OCR solutions like pytesseract.

3. Financial Information Summarization
	‚Ä¢	Prompt-based LLM Summarization: Send extracted text to OpenAI‚Äôs GPT models (gpt-4o or gpt-3.5-turbo) using custom finance-focused prompts.
	‚Ä¢	Output: Extract structured key metrics:
	‚Ä¢	Revenue, Profit, Growth %
	‚Ä¢	Gross and Net NPAs (for banks/NBFCs)
	‚Ä¢	Management Tone/Outlook
	‚Ä¢	Expansion/Risk commentary

4. Data Storage
	‚Ä¢	Summaries are saved as:
	‚Ä¢	Text summaries
	‚Ä¢	JSON files for structured data
	‚Ä¢	(Later) Could be inserted into a database (Postgres/SQLite)

5. Frontend Display 
	‚Ä¢	Simple Flask + React dashboard or CSV download.
	‚Ä¢	Features: Search by Company, Sector, Time Period, Financial Metrics.
